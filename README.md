Starfield (with an Oddball)
For this assignment you will make a animation of fireworks. This common animation is called a "starfield" since it can also be used to simulate movement through a field of stars. You may find slides 35 - 52 on OOP--Inheritance & Encapsulation presentation helpful.

Program requirements:
Your program must use at least two classes to model the particles. A Particle super class and an Oddball sub class. All the particles must be stored in a single array of the super class type. Make sure you do not unnunnecessarily duplicate inherited variables and functions in the Oddball sub class. Your Oddball sub class need only contain a constructor and void move() and/or void show() so that the Oddball moves and/or looks different.

Suggested steps to completing this assignment
Fork this repository
First, finish the Particle class. It will need the following members:
5 member variables: X and Y positions, Color, Angle and Speed. (Hint: use doubles for X, Y, Speed and Angle)
Particle(), the class constructor
void move(), Takes the cos of the angle times the speed and adds it to the X coordinate. Does the same to Y with the sin of the angle.
void show(), draws the particle in the correct color
Now finish the program's setup() and draw()
Add one Particle variable, and make sure you can see it move
Add an array of type Particle and loop through it to move and show all the Particles.
Create an OddballParticle class that extends the Particle class.
Change the first element in the array to a OddballParticle instead of a Particle
Run your program. Make sure you can see the Oddball.
